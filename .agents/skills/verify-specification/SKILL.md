description: Drives the Specification library's EF6 and EF Core providers as a consuming project does. It builds a nullable-enabled console consumer against any commit and runs its queries on the spec-sql SQL Server. Use it to verify, smoke-test or compare a change to src/Ardalis.Specification.EntityFramework6 or src/Ardalis.Specification.EntityFrameworkCore.

# Verify the Specification library

The library has no app of its own. Its user is a developer whose project references a provider package, so this skill stands in for that project with a **consumer**: a net9.0 console project with nullable enabled, built against one commit's EF6 provider. Its build shows the warnings a caller gets. Its run queries SQL Server through `RepositoryBase<T>` and the `DbSet` extensions. The **EF Core consumer** is the same kind of project, built against the EF Core provider. Its run enumerates `AsAsyncEnumerable` through `RepositoryBase<T>` and `ContextFactoryRepositoryBaseOfT`, and queries a shop with the consumer's rows through the `DbSet` extensions. [features/README.md](features/README.md) maps what each recipe drives.

Every step goes through one helper, `.agents/skills/verify-specification/bin/verify`, called `verify` below; `verify help` lists its commands. In a skillflow run, prefix each call with skillflow's `bin/sandbox`.

## Launch

1. Export each commit you drive as a **tree**: `T=$(verify tree <commit>)`. It runs `git archive`, so the tree holds exactly that commit, without uncommitted edits, and the checkout stays as it was. A tree is reused while it exists.
2. Make a consumer from the tree: `C=$(verify consumer "$T" <name>)`, or `C=$(verify efcore-consumer "$T" <name>)` for the EF Core consumer. The name defaults to the tree's short sha, and making a name again replaces that consumer.

The consumer is ready when `verify build "$C"` ends `build: exit 0`. Its run creates and seeds its own database, `VerifySpecificationConsumer`, or `VerifySpecificationEFCoreConsumer` for the EF Core consumer, so nothing needs seeding first.

## Doctor

`verify doctor` checks without writing. It looks for a .NET SDK 9 or later, the repository and its HEAD, and a listener on SQL Server's port. The server comes from `SPECIFICATION_TEST_SQL_SERVER`, or else CONTRIBUTING.md's spec-sql connection string. It also checks the shared lock's folder and the scratch root, and lists each tree and consumer with the commit it came from. It exits 1 on any `fail:` line. The port check doesn't log in; the first `verify run` does.

## Drive

- `verify build "$C"` builds the consumer, and the provider it references, for net9.0. It prints `warning <file>:<line> <code> <message>` once for each distinct warning, then `warnings: <n>`, then one `probe` line for each probe in the consumer's probe files, `Probes.cs` and then any other `*Probes.cs`, then `build: exit <n>`. A probe line reads `probe <name> (<file>:<line>): got <codes>; an annotated provider gives <codes>`.
- `verify run "$C"` runs the consumer against SQL Server while it holds `~/.cache/specification-spec-sql.lock`, the lock AGENTS.md puts around every test run. It prints one `label: result` line per query, then drops its database. Runs take turns on the lock with each other and with the test suite, so two never share the database at once.
- `verify warnings "$T/<path>.csproj" [-p:Nullable=<value>]` builds any project in a tree for every target framework, with `--no-incremental`. It prints each distinct warning with the frameworks it appeared in, NuGet's and MSBuild's included. A warning without a source position shows its project, or `MSBUILD`, in place of `<file>:<line>`. Run `tests/warnings.sh` first: it proves the report reads every form, and the map's recipes for `verify warnings` start with it.
- `verify benchmark "$T" <folder> <method>...` runs `<folder>/Program.cs`, a BenchmarkDotNet workload with `[MemoryDiagnoser]`, against the tree's EF6 provider in Release. Keep the workload in your run folder; the helper builds it in `consumers/benchmark-<sha>` under the scratch root, and no compiler server or MSBuild node outlives the run. BenchmarkDotNet's logs and reports go to `<folder>/results-<sha>/`, beside `run.log`, the run's whole output. It prints the report, then `allocated <method>: <values>` or `no allocation <method>: <why>` for each method you name, then `benchmark: exit <n>`. It exits 1 unless every method you name has a row and every row an allocation, since BenchmarkDotNet exits 0 for a case it rejected or couldn't run.
- `verify benchmark compare "$B" "$T" <folder> <workload>...` times the merge base's code against the branch's in one process, since times from separate runs moved 4.5% to 5.4% for code neither run changed (#7's run). `<folder>/base-files` lists the files to take from the base tree `$B`, one path inside the EF6 provider per line, such as `Evaluators/IncludeEvaluator.cs`, with each provider file it calls. They compile into the workload in the namespace `MergeBase`, and the provider the workload references is `$T`'s. A base file that uses the core library's internals doesn't compile there. For each workload `W`, `Program.cs` has `MergeBase_W`, marked `[Benchmark(Baseline = true)]`, and `Branch_W`, both in `[BenchmarkCategory("W")]`, on a class with `[GroupBenchmarksBy(BenchmarkLogicalGroupRule.ByCategory)]`. The results go to `<folder>/compare-<base sha>-<sha>/`. It prints `compare W: allocated <base>, then <branch>; Ratio <r>, RatioSD <sd>` for each workload, and exits 1 unless each has both allocations and the branch's Ratio and RatioSD. "No slower" reads as no Ratio above 1.00 by more than its RatioSD.
- To compare a branch with where it started, drive two trees, `$(git merge-base origin/HEAD HEAD)` and `HEAD`, make a consumer for each, and `diff` their outputs.

Each feature file gives the commands and the observable result for its sub-features.

## Evidence

Save each command's stdout, with the command and the tree's commit, in the evidence folder your task names. In a skillflow run, that is `RUN/artifacts/<step>/`. The helper writes only inside its scratch root, and `verify benchmark` also in its workload's `results-<sha>/`, so cleanup never reaches the evidence.

A comparison keeps both outputs and their diff. Before it calls two outputs equal, it shows that each holds the rows the criterion is about, since two empty outputs are equal.

## Cleanup

`verify cleanup <item>...` removes the trees and consumers it names. `verify cleanup` alone removes all of them, then the scratch root. Either way, it removes only a folder directly under the scratch root's `trees/` or `consumers/` that holds the `.verify-made` marker, after it resolves `..` and links, and it refuses anything else. Before it makes a folder, the helper also removes its own items older than a day. The run drops its database when it ends. A run killed midway leaves its database behind, and the next run of that kind of consumer drops it first.

## Helpers

- `bin/verify` is the CLI above. Its scratch root is `/tmp/verify-specification-<uid>`, with mode 700. The repository's `.gitignore` ignores every `bin/` folder and every `*.log` file, so a new file there, or a saved log such as a test's fixture, needs `git add -f`.
- `consumer-template/` holds the consumer. `Program.cs` has the queries and `Probes.cs` the compile-only nullable probes. A run that needs another query or probe adds it there, and adds its sub-feature to the feature map. A probe of #11's DbSet extensions goes in `with-dbset-reads/` instead, since a tree without them can't build it.
- `efcore-consumer-template/` holds the EF Core consumer's project and its queries, in `Program.cs` and `Shop.cs`. Its project takes the version of `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` from the tree's `Directory.Packages.props`.
- `consumer-shared/` holds files both consumers get, such as `DbSetReads.cs`, the specifications their DbSet lines run. A line that calls #11's DbSet extensions sits under `#if DBSET_READS`, which `verify consumer` and `verify efcore-consumer` define only for a tree that has them. For such a tree they also copy the template's `with-dbset-reads/`, which holds its DbSet probes, so `verify build` reads every probe file it finds.
- `consumer-snippets/` holds files that a feature's recipe copies into a consumer of its own, because each one fails to build on one side of the change it checks. [features/query-builder.md](features/query-builder.md) uses them.
- `benchmark-template/` holds the project file `verify benchmark` writes beside a workload. `tests/benchmark.sh` plays saved BenchmarkDotNet runs back through a stand-in dotnet: one with allocations, two that measured nothing and exited 0, and #7's same-process comparison, whole and without its Ratio and RatioSD columns.
- `tests/guards.sh` locks the guards on cleanup and on each command that writes. `tests/warnings.sh` checks that the warning report reads every form MSBuild and NuGet write. It builds the two projects in `tests/msbuild-warnings/` for real, and feeds the forms they can't yield through a stand-in dotnet. `tests/probes.sh` builds both consumers from a tree with #11's DbSet extensions and from one without, with LF and then CRLF probe files, and checks every probe line; [features/dbset-read-extensions.md](features/dbset-read-extensions.md) runs it too. The `[pr]` suite in `skillflow.toml` runs every script in `tests/`. Run them after any change to `bin/verify`.
